# Fashion_MNIST_Classification

## The libraries used

matplotlib 
numpy
sklearn
tensorflow.keras

## The motivation for the project

In this project, the fashion MNIST dataset is used to train the different machine learning methods, including the logistic regression classifier, random forest classifier, artificial neural network and convolutional neural network. The purposes of this project is to understand which models are better in this case
